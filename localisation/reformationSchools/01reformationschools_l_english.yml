calvinist_school_desc:0 "Calvinism is a theological system founded by John Calvin in the 16th century, emphasizing the sovereignty of God, predestination, and the authority of Scripture. Known for its disciplined approach to faith and governance, Calvinism advocates for a structured, moral society with a strong focus on education, hard work, and communal accountability. It spread widely in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Scotland, and parts of France, influencing both religious and political life with its organized church structures and emphasis on individual responsibility within a covenantal community."
zwinglian_school:0 "Zwingli" #sm
zwinglian_school_desc:0 "Zwinglism is a branch of Protestantism founded by Huldrych Zwingli in early 16th-century Zurich. It emphasizes the authority of Scripture, the rejection of practices not explicitly found in the Bible, and a symbolic interpretation of the Eucharist, differing from the Catholic and even Lutheran views. Zwingli's reforms sought to simplify church practices, remove iconography, and foster a faith community grounded in reasoned interpretation and direct engagement with the Bible. Zwinglism spread primarily in Switzerland and laid foundational ideas for the broader Reformed tradition, influencing later movements like Calvinism."
huguenots_school:0 "Huguenots"
huguenots_school_desc:0 "Huguenots refere to the movement that emerged in the 16th century, heavily influenced by Calvinist theology. The Huguenots emphasized the authority of Scripture, predestination, and a personal relationship with God, distinguishing themselves from the Catholic majority in France. Despite severe persecution, including events like the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, Huguenots built resilient communities and were known for their industriousness and skill in diplomacy. Their faith and cultural contributions shaped France’s religious landscape, and after the Edict of Nantes, they enjoyed a brief period of relative tolerance, though many eventually fled to Protestant-friendly regions across Europe due to renewed suppression."
puritan_school:0 "Puritans" #ism
puritan_school_desc:0 "Puritanism was a movement in 16th- and 17th-century England, aimed at 'purifying' the Church of England from practices seen as too closely aligned with Catholicism. Rooted in Calvinist theology, Puritans emphasized a strict moral code, the authority of Scripture, and a disciplined, introspective lifestyle. They advocated for simpler worship, rejecting ornate rituals and emphasizing personal piety and community accountability. Puritans played a significant role in English politics, especially during the English Civil War, and many later migrated to North America, where they sought to establish a "godly" society, leaving a lasting influence on American culture and religious identity."
baptists_school:0 "Baptism"
baptists_school_desc:0 "Baptism is a Christian movement that emerged in the early 17th century, emphasizing believer's baptism—that is, the practice of baptizing individuals who consciously profess faith, rather than infant baptism. Baptists advocate for religious freedom, the separation of church and state, and congregational governance, where each local church operates independently. Grounded in a commitment to the authority of Scripture and personal faith, Baptists uphold principles like individual accountability and a direct relationship with God. The movement spread rapidly across England, Europe, and later North America, where it became one of the largest Protestant denominations, influencing religious and civic life with its emphasis on freedom of conscience."
knoxite_school:0 "Knox"
knoxite_school_desc:0 "The teachings of John Knox, the Scottish reformer who brought Calvinist ideas to Scotland in the 16th century emphasize the authority of Scripture, predestination, and the sovereignty of God, similar to Calvinist doctrine, but with a strong focus on national identity and independence from external religious authorities. Knox advocated for a church governed by elders (presbyterian polity), rejecting the hierarchy of bishops. His reforms shaped the Scottish Reformation, leading to the establishment of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and influencing Protestant movements in Scotland and Ireland."
vasantine_school:0 "Vasa"
vasantine_school_desc:0 "Vasantine School is a Protestant branch influenced by the Swedish King Gustav Vasa, who led the Reformation in Sweden in the 16th century.

The Vasantine School reflects a blend of Lutheran theology and strong state influence, with an emphasis on religious unity, discipline, and loyalty to the crown. Vasantine Protestantism played a crucial role in shaping Swedish identity, governance, and the spread of Lutheran ideas throughout Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic regions."
tausenite_school:0 "Tausen"
tausenite_school_desc:0 "Protestant movement based on the teachings of Hans Tausen, known as the "Danish Luther," who pioneered the Reformation in Denmark and Norway in the early 16th century. Tausenites emphasized Lutheran principles such as salvation by faith, the authority of Scripture, and the simplification of church practices. Tausen’s reforms encouraged a move away from Catholic rituals and promoted services in the vernacular to make faith accessible to all. This school was instrumental in establishing Lutheranism as the state religion in Denmark and Norway, fostering a national Protestant identity that balanced traditional values with reformed doctrine."
julianic_school:0 "Julianic"
julianic_school_desc:0 "Julianic School is a unique Protestant movement emerging in Southern Iberia and Italy, influenced by reform-minded Spanish smugglers and dissenters who sought religious change despite Catholic dominance.

Arminians emphasize free will, arguing that God's grace enables human choice in accepting salvation, contrasting with Calvinist determinism. This school values a more inclusive approach, highlighting God's universal love and the potential for anyone to be saved. Originating in the Lowlands, Arminianism influenced broader Protestant debates on grace and human agency, ultimately impacting movements like Methodism and shaping Protestant perspectives on salvation, choice, and accountability."

socinian_school_desc:0 "Socinianism is a rationalist branch originating in the 16th century, founded by Italian reformers Lelio and Fausto Sozzini (Socinus) and popularized in Poland and Transylvania. Socinians rejected orthodox doctrines like the Trinity, original sin, and predestination, instead emphasizing the unity of God, the moral teachings of Jesus, and salvation through following Christ's example. They prioritized reason and ethics in interpreting Scripture, promoting religious tolerance and freedom of conscience. Socinianism laid groundwork for later Unitarian thought, influencing Enlightenment thinkers and contributing to the development of liberal religious movements focused on reason, morality, and individual belief."

Though political and religious opposition hindered his efforts, Laski's work influenced the spread of Reformation ideas in Poland and neighboring regions."
molinist_school:0 "Molina" #Molinism
molinist_school_desc:0 "Theological system developed by Jesuit philosopher Luis de Molina in the late 16th century, primarily within Catholic Spain. Molinism seeks to reconcile God's omniscience with human free will through the concept of "middle knowledge," whereby God knows all possible outcomes of human choices without predetermining them. This allows for divine foreknowledge while preserving human freedom, a significant departure from strict determinist views. Although rooted in Catholicism, Molinism influenced broader theological debates on free will and predestination, impacting both Catholic and Protestant thinkers and contributing to nuanced discussions about divine providence and human responsibility."

Lutheranism introduced vernacular worship, simplified church rituals, and encouraged personal Bible reading. Initially concentrated in Germany and Scandinavia, Lutheranism became a prominent Christian denomination, shaping religious thought, education, and cultural values across Europe and influencing Protestant movements worldwide."
