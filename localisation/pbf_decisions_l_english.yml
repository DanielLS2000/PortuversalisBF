 zpd_form_decision_desc: "The West Slavs have always been shunned, by Slavs, for being too Western, and by the West, for being too Slavic.  We must tear off these shackles and unite our peoples into one Kingdom, the Kingdom of Zapadoslavia!"
 reign_in_the_hungarians_title:0 "Reign in the Hungarians"
 reign_in_the_hungarians_desc:0 "Many of the southern Slavs argue Hungarians are really just Slavs like the rest of us.  However, many also argue they aren't Slavic at all.  Regardless, we believe it will be easy to integrate them into the Union should we control their lands."
## Austro-Bavaria
 austra_bavaria_nation_title: "Unite the Crowns of Austria and Bavaria"
 austra_bavaria_nation_desc: "The likes of the Protestant Reformation and the German Renaissance are bringing to light many new ideas and also several new feuds that both Austrians and Bavarians are trying to sort out. Staying true to Catholicism and refusing to bow to the harsh rhetoric of various other states in the Holy Roman Empire, it would seem that Austrians and Bavarians have a lot in common when it comes to politics and religion alone. Perhaps these similarities can be joined together into a firm union between the two crowns so that a bastion of Catholicism remains in the Holy Roman Empire whilst fighting for what is truly just inside the its borders."
## Belgium
 belgium_nation_title: "Belgian Independence?"
 belgium_nation_desc: "The Dutch think so highly of themselves and the French pressure our people from the west and south, and still the Germanic people to our southeast encroach on our position in Europe. What are the Flemish and Walloon people supposed to do when they feel that no ther state around them treats them as an equal part of matters? Politics on both a communal level and a state level have continued to glaze over the fact that the Flemish and Walloon people toil away without end, but with new ideas spreading and political opportunities coming about, we need to seek an independent state for both people groups."
## Polabia
 polabia_nation_title: "The Edge of the Western Slavs"
 polabia_nation_desc: "Alongside the Czech people, the Polabian tribes were part of the frontier of Western Slavic settlements centuries ago. Yet, being disunited in the face of increasingly strong states in all directions led to the steady partition and subjugation of all Polabian tribes (even our own relatives in the form of the Poles helped strike Polabians down). But still, the memories from those previous centuries are still around as descendants of old Polabian tribes have stayed alive in small, isolated pockets of the Holy Roman Empire. Let us unite these scattered kin of ours into one formal nation, transcending past the old tribal bonds and feuds and cultivating a truly unique state that is at the border with the heart of the Germans."
## Lombardy
 Lombardy_formation_title: "Restore the Lombardian Kingdom"
 Lombardy_formation_desc: "Beside the Lombardian people, remnants of our kingdom persist, scattered within the Holy Roman Empire. Today, let's unite these fragments into a formal nation, transcending old feuds. Together, we'll revive the Lombardian Kingdom, reclaiming the grandeur of our past. Long live Lombardy!"
