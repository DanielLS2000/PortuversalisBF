Small nations are being annexed into [global_threat_country.GetName] at an alarming pace. This presents a significant threat to our sovereignty and the right to sovereignty of every nation in the area.\nClosed-door discussions are stalled on the formation of a grand coalition to fight against [global_threat_country.GetName], as no nation has yet taken up the mantle to lead. Yet, one-by-one these nations have begun to look to $COUNTRY$ for guidance. We project strong sovereign values in ways that inspire other nations. They trust us to have the ability to lead them to victory against [global_threat_country.GetName], should we deem it necessary. Where we go, they will follow."

We wish to choose our own path in the world.\nYet here we are, bending the knee to an overlord who is not worthy. We have sacrificed our sovereignty for security. Our people do not like this. They believe we can look after ourselves. If anything we should be their overlord!\nAs you walk into the court of your overlord you can tell they are not impressed. They will offer to invest in your nation and pay more attention to your domestic affairs. They will attempt to placate us.\nAnd so we must ask ourselves, is self-determination truly what is best for us?"

 new_idea_groups_mod.302.b:0 "I need them in my court."
 new_idea_groups_mod.303.t:0 "Criminal Drafting"
 new_idea_groups_mod.303.d:0 "Looting and pillaging can be considered fantastic pasttimes in ideal circumstances. This is why we have currently drafted captured criminals and theives into the military. Rather than executing them for their crimes, they can serve the nation with the highest honor a man can be given."
 new_idea_groups_mod.303.a:0 "Their 'skills' will be of some use."
 new_idea_groups_mod.304.t:0 "Artillery Technology Advancements"
 new_idea_groups_mod.304.d:0 "One of our great military thinkers has been developing some new artillery technology, which he believes may change the face of warfare forever. While the theory seems good, the practicality of the design is... questionable. A few rudimentary samples have been created and it is intended to deploy them in battle and study how they perform. However, these new artillery are fragile and we do not wish our enemies to decipher our technology, so we must use them sparingly."
 new_idea_groups_mod.304.a:0 "Use them only for battles."
 new_idea_groups_mod.304.b:0 "Save them for the seiges."
 new_idea_groups_mod.304.c:0 "Why not both?"
 new_idea_groups_mod.305.t:0 "Purebred Horses"
 new_idea_groups_mod.305.d:0 "Our horses carry many desirable traits. They also carry a number of undesirable traits, such as excreting during battle. A couple of our farmers have discovered ways of breeding the horses to maximase the number of positive traits the offspring have. This sounds like an excellent scheme the military could make use of."
 new_idea_groups_mod.305.a:0 "This is an excellent investment."
 new_idea_groups_mod.305.b:0 "Don't buy into it."
 new_idea_groups_mod.306.t:0 "Improved Supply Lines"
 new_idea_groups_mod.306.d:0 "We have managed to safeguard many of the supply lines that run to the front lines of our war. This has enabled us to operate our supply network with incredible efficiency. Already, the benefits are being realised on the front lines."
 new_idea_groups_mod.306.a:0 "We can deliver fresh recruits to the frontline."
 new_idea_groups_mod.306.b:0 "This will reduce attrition casualties."

 new_idea_groups_mod.307.b:0 "Cash in now."
 new_idea_groups_mod.308.t:0 "Battlefield Heroics"
 new_idea_groups_mod.308.d:0 "Stories of great heroic acts are making their way back from the battlefield. The foot soldier that fought valiantly against four foes and defeated them all. The horseman that rescued a number of civilians from incoming artillery fire. The medic that treated over a dozen wounded soldiers per hour, bringing them back from the brink of death.\nThe glory of our army has invigorated support for the war."
 new_idea_groups_mod.308.a:0 "These stories will live forever."
 new_idea_groups_mod.309.t:0 "Poor Training"
 new_idea_groups_mod.309.d:0 "It has come to our attention that a vital gap in our military training regime has resulted in our soldiers being sent to the battlefield with insufficent knowledge about movement and cohesion as a group. Word has it that our armies are slightly disorganised, especially when packing up camp for the night."
 new_idea_groups_mod.309.a:0 "We will review our training programme."
 new_idea_groups_mod.310.t:0 "Cavalry Academy"
 new_idea_groups_mod.310.d:0 "Cavalry is known to be the most understated part of our army. While people are still interested in riding horses and training to be master horsemen, our infantry seem to be neglecting the cavalry-focused elements of their training. They don't seem to know how to maneuver and interact with cavalry on the battlefield, let alone clean up after them. We need to train our soldiers to support the cavalry with more efficiency and it has been suggested that a cavalry training programme be built for this purpose."
 new_idea_groups_mod.310.a:0 "Don't build the academy."
 new_idea_groups_mod.310.b:0 "Build the academy."
 new_idea_groups_mod.310.c:0 "I will conduct the training myself."
 new_idea_groups_mod.311.t:0 "Lack of Suitable Generals"

 new_idea_groups_mod.311.a:0 "Search harder."
 new_idea_groups_mod.312.t:0 "Logistical Disaster"
 new_idea_groups_mod.312.d:0 "Logistics and supply only works when you actually implement it. We have spent too much time plotting and scheming and not enough time doing. Our supply networks around the country have deteriorated to an unusable state and are in dire need of repair."
 new_idea_groups_mod.312.a:0 "This will hurt the military."
 new_idea_groups_mod.312.b:0 "This will hurt the economy."
 new_idea_groups_mod.312.c:0 "Clean this mess up!"
