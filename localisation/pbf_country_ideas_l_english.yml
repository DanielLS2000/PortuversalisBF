 ZPD_ideas_bonus: "Zapadoslavian Ambition"
 zpd_idea_1: "East-West Trade"

 zpd_idea_2: "Estates Act"

 AUB_BAV_ideas_bonus: "Bavaria-Austrian Ambition"
 reinheitsgebot_for_our_beer: "Reinheitsgebot!"
 reinheitsgebot_for_our_beer_desc: "For far too long we have seen beer in German lands be made with a great deal of wrong and impure ingredients. While it is true that previous regulations regarding beer making have been passed at more local levels, in Austria-Bavaria there will be a much more strict enforcement of this legislation so that price competition with bakers for wheat and rye does not arise. The only ingredients allowed for beer made in our lands are as follows: water, barley, and hops."
 the_troublesome_south_and_east: "Troubles to the South and East"
 the_troublesome_south_and_east_desc: "Whilst Bavarian lands have been relatively safe inside of the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian lands have been plagued by issues with Hungarians, Turks, and Slavs of different sorts in the Balkans. These skirmishes and border conflicts to our south and east have given the military of Austria-Bavaria a fairly good understanding of how the field of battle works and it continually gives them motivation to keep the borders safe from further incursions."
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab: "Fuggers and Welsers"
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab_desc: "The illustriously wealthy mercantile families that are the Fuggers and Welsers know great fortune throughout Augsburg as well as other lands throughout the Holy Roman Empire, but none more so than perhaps Austria-Bavaria. If we can continue to harness their financial skills for our own affairs, Austria-Bavaria will always be ready for whatever financial mishaps come through in the future."
 navigating_hre_politics: "Navigating Holy Roman Politics"
 navigating_hre_politics_desc: "Moving through political schemes and diplomatic incidents throughout the Holy Roman Empire is not easy in the slightest, but the Austrian nobility and administration are adept at handling such matters. Bavarians may handle other duties better than Austrians, but when it comes to ensuring that diplomacy and politics are stowed away safely and without worry, Austrians are the ones to look toward."
 monpolizing_various_industries: "Monpolize German Industries"
 monpolizing_various_industries_desc: "Whether it is the copper industry, the salt industry, or even the paper-making industry, Austria-Bavaria is likely to have interests in it. German industries of various economic goods are thriving already, but we know that they could thrive even more if they were simply under better management and leadership. We shouldn't stress too much over this though, for in time we will obtain full hegemony over these economic factors and there will be less competition against us."
 discipline_of_the_grenzers: "Age of the Grenzers"
 discipline_of_the_grenzers_desc: "Keeping up with our borders is no easy task and though our military are motivated to keep it protected, new tactics and strategies that incorporate new military technology need to be developed. By shifting over to light infantry as opposed to continuing with heavy infantry will be key to Austria-Bavaria keeping up militarily, and these new Grenzers (otherwise known as 'frontiersman') will help us master new methods of doing battle."
 mastery_of_soft_power: "Master of Soft Power"
 mastery_of_soft_power_desc: "To project soft power outward and to use it to the benefit of the state is something that few in history have ever come to master. There are those few states and families that were able to thread the needles just right and get their family members and friendly courtiers into specific courts and halls to make a huge difference for one particular side. Austria-Bavaria will be exactly that kind of state, as its power not only comes from the words of its diplomats and royal family members, but also from its military that backs up every decree and action."
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance: "German Renaissance Attraction"
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance_desc: "The birth of great scholars and artists alike in the Italian Peninsula has led to a plethora of people from the Holy Roman Empire becoming inspired to bring these ideas northward over the decades. The German Renaissance, as some have called it, has thus brought great ideas and minds to Austria-Bavaria which is something that both Bavarian and Austrian courts benefit from greatly. Not only will our prestige last throughout the ages, but the ideas we espouse as well will last beyond our current generation."
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army: "To be Absolutist"
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army_desc: "The authority of the monarch is increasing as time goes on despite attempts to pull them back from this culmination of absolute authority. Though Austria-Bavaria has its own share of thoughts on Absolutism as a whole, we cannot deny that having a strong standing army is becoming a sign of a modernized and capable state. We must work on dismissing the system of feudal levies and work toward making our military something of a professional standard that can withstand foreign tactics and strategies."
 army_restructuring: "Prepared for the Next Age"
 army_restructuring_desc: "Just as Austria-Bavaria is becoming its own by slowly building up its power through diplomatic and military means, there are others out there who seek to best Austria-Bavaria in the heat of a large war for succcession or land. What then must be done? Perhaps the only thing that can be done is to restructure the military to handle these larger threats on our border whether they are French, Russian, Turkish, or some other state looking to pry off pieces of Austria-Bavaria."

 the_belgian_revolution: "Subjects No More"
 the_belgian_revolution_desc: "We have toiled under unjust authority for far too long, have we not? And what were the fruits of our labor despite the unjust burdens put upon us? Freedom and glory! Though it was hard to gain the status we currently hold and many may not like us currently, we can build up from where we are and build a solid state that listens to its people and represents them fairly."
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french: "Distinct, yet Familiar"
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french_desc: "Belgium is a mish-mash of two distinct though familiar cultures in the region the Low Countries. The Walloon people come from the lands of France whilst the Flemish people come from the Netherlands, though both have felt just how horrible things can be when the governing body if ineffective in every single way possible. Now is the time for both Flemish and Walloon to flourish into a truly charismatic and prestigous state that can stand out amongst European states as one that seeks both righteous governance and honest diplomacy."
 refusal_of_pure_despotism: "The Cracking of Monarchies"
 refusal_of_pure_despotism_desc: "Belgium's inception is something of bell ringing out all across Europe: the age of monarchs ruling with absolute power is not an age that will last forever. Some dynasties and leaders think the sun will shine on them until the end of time, but Belgium is almost living proof that the authority of despotism cannot go on forever without revolution from beneath later on. From this point on, Belgium must be a bastion of reform and compromise in its highest levels of office, even if we choose to have a monarch in power."
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language: "Promote Flemish and Walloon"
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language_desc: "French has been the traditional language of our court and official documents for a while now, but hanging on to the French identity through their language is only going to make Belgian politics more and more messy as time goes on. We should start shifting toward using Walloon and Flemish as the standard language of our courts so that we better represent our own people and we aren't leaning so hard on the traditions of others."
 continual_french_support: "Continual French Support"
 continual_french_support_desc: "Some of the French are eager to support us for one reason or another; perhaps it is to undermine the power of the Dutch or to gain influence further eastward. Whilst some in Belgium are suspicious of the French and their intentions, touting that they will want to annex Belgium altogether in the near future, we shouldn't be so quick to turn down French support after how far we have come. If we can build up our infrastructure and military based on French military principles, we'll be able to have an easier time fielding Belgian regiments in general."
 formulate_belgian_political_parties: "Solidify Belgian Politics"
 formulate_belgian_political_parties_desc: "The landscape of Belgium is diverse in some aspects, but also quite monotonous in other respects. Where it becomes especially interesting is in regards to political matters as the linguistic and cultural groups have drawn their rough lines all throughout Belgium already. Learning more about these groups on a person-to-person basis will allow for the formation of more stable and less violent political movements as we continue forth."
 evenly_distribute_the_burden: "The Even Burden"
 evenly_distribute_the_burden_desc: "And as we pass laws and edicts toward our diverse yet strong populous, we do so knowing that we are attempting act in their best interest at all times. Shady deals and corruption scandals may arise, but we will root out the traitors to Belgian politics as quickly as we can and maintain the great peace in our land that should always be present."
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen: "Business is Business"
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen_desc: "Though the Flemish may be seen by the Dutch in the Netherlands as 'lower' Dutchmen, the Flemish can do just as well with regards to trade negotiations and making a good profit. If our rivals want to compete against Belgian interests in markets around Europe and outside of Europe, then we will give them no quarter and ensure that all profits stream back to us whenever possible."
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities: "Minor Cultures of Belgium"
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities_desc: "Those who are distinctly French and German are easy to spot in Belgian land since they do not identify with Walloon or Flemish people and will make that fact known if counted in a census of any sort. These minorities should be rightfully accounted for and given some form of representation so that there is good communication between the minor groups of people in Belgium and the administration itself."
 high_level_diplomacy: "A Look in the Mirror"
 high_level_diplomacy_desc: "As we settle our internal affairs and seek out both alliances and trade treaties with states around us, we need to always be mindful of how we look to foreign powers. Is Belgium overstepping its limits? How does our military seem to foreigners near to us? These are just a couple questions our diplomats and officials should keep in mind when conducting diplomacy since it can help determine how we should be doing things inside our nation."
# Polabia
 PBA_ideas: "Polabian Ideas"
 PBA_ideas_start: "Polabian Traditions"
 PBA_ideas_bonus: "Polabian Ambition"
 fading_memories_reaffirmed: "Polabian Memories, Revived!"
 fading_memories_reaffirmed_desc: "Whether it was the bastards that are the Danes to the north or the fiends that are the German states to the west, Polabian land has been chipped away at for centuries. Even after the Slavic Revolt of 983 that saw several Christian settlements plundered and destroyed, the steady 'Ostsiedlung' continued and much of the Polabian homeland was Germanized over time. Those that weathered the storm of Germanic cultural assimilation, however, now stand tall and proud within an independent Polabian nation! Let their efforts shine through the military, clergy, and peasantry alike for generations to come!"
 militarized_once_more: "The Need for Militancy"
 militarized_once_more_desc: "Polabian people in one cohesive political unit, it's a frightening prospect for several states surrounding the region where Polabians called home in the past. Danes, Germans of various royal houses, and even Poles look to our state as something that may need to be culled with the combined might of various allies. It is exactly this sentiment that we must militarize parts of Polabian society like how they were in the past, so that if invaders from all directions come through to smite us down, they will know only bloodshed, hardship, and eventual defeat."
 paid_tribute_is_returned_to_us: "Collecting what is Owed"
 paid_tribute_is_returned_to_us_desc: "The Polabian people of the past were split into several tribes of varying status and power, yet it was because they were so disunited that Germanic and Danish leaders were able to invade and subjugate various tribes so that tribute and fealty was paid. Now that the tables are reversed to a degree, we can enact our own tribute policies on our various subjects and keep them in line, just like what was done to our people in previous ages."
 revival_of_polabian_culture: "Affirm Polabian Culture"
 revival_of_polabian_culture_desc: "The memories of Polabian culture like common festivals, religious practices, and even the languages that were spoken in the various tribes are mostly different now. Some minor parts have survived, but largely we are left to Germanic chronicles on what Polabian culture used to be like. Perhaps it would be wise to investigate these chronicles so that we could organize certain Polabian festivals and customs once more, though understandably not every part of our ancestral culture needs to be reaffirmed. Piece by piece, we will build ourselves a nation on the foundations of the past and the present."
 northern_raiders_have_taught_us: "Beware the Rivers and Coasts!"
 northern_raiders_have_taught_us_desc: "The northern raiders are devious bastards that much is for sure, yet they've done away with this practice of raiding and looting coastal villages and towns as time has gone on. Settling into the Christian mold for the Danes has led to a number of changes, sure, but it's led to them forsaking a practice that could have bolstered their power and kept the coasts in the north further under their authority."
 reorganize_land_along_polabian_lines: "Polabian Organization of Land"
 reorganize_land_along_polabian_lines_desc: "If there is one growing issue in Polabia it is the fact that land is organized in varied ways due to a resurgence of Polabian culture clashing with Germanic customs. The mold set by previous centuries after the defeat of Polabians in general in the 11s has meant that we are dealing with a very tense issue, one that needs to be handled closely and carefully by our ruler and their advisors lest the corruption and unrest grows out of control throughout Polabia."
 reformation_of_the_gords: "Across the Land are Gords"
 reformation_of_the_gords_desc: "Some see it as a symbol of an era long gone, yet others see it as a relic that can be refurbished into something useful again. These gords are essentially fortified earthworks that are usually situated near key rivers, hills, lakes, or peninsulas (for natural defenses), and they usually are elevated to a degree; nearby, of course, would be small communities of peasants so as to help sustain the gords in general. We should take after these gords and work to set up strong fortifications across Polabia, but with natural defenses in mind so as to cut down on construction costs and to help bolster their defensive potential."

Although it was primitive compared to Roman or German laws at the time and is definitely out of date, we shall build our laws upon this legacy free of outsider influence and become an example for the rest of the world, as well as maintaining unified grip over our domain."
 Citta_ad_Isole: "Citta ad Isole"
 Citta_ad_Isole_desc: "Northern Italy is perfectly suited for ongoing urbanization, with its fertile flatlands and city-state traditions. This resulted in creation of citta ad isole (city islands) and subsequently some of the greatest cities in the world like Florence, Pisa, Pavia, Milan and Padua. The ever-growing population and riches of those places results in some of the most prestigious buildings that ever came to be. "
 the_italian_frontier: "The Italian Frontier"
 the_italian_frontier_desc: "While the Italian interior is full of flatlands, the only way into our homelands is through the harsh terrain of Alps or by the sea. Kings and emperors came and went, while we adapted and can use this situation to our advantage. Will anyone dare to stumble across our lands, we shall make sure no supply or reinforcements reaches their troops."
 iron_crown_of_lombardy: "Iron Crown Of Lombardy"
 iron_crown_of_lombardy_desc: "The Iron Crown was used for centuries by Kings of Unified Italy.

 trace_italienne: "Trace Italienne"
 trace_italienne_desc: "While the entire world is focused on bringing in more and more cannons into warfare, crumbling old-timed castles within days, we focused on countering the change. Italian engineers designed a new fort - with thick earthen ramparts and ditches that we now implement across our entire nation. This new design suits the modern warfare and we will make sure to forever stay pioneers on the matter."
 gastaldi: "Gastaldi"
 gastaldi_desc: "Gastaldi Longobardi was a system of managing our Kingdom in its prime years. It served as a counterweight to the hereditary dukes with gastaldos being chosen for temporary service by the king himself. They had the same power as the dukes over their lands, while maintaining freedom from familiar feuds and having been chosen by their skill rather than their status. We should implement this system once more to ensure smooth bureaucratic process within our old and new territories."
