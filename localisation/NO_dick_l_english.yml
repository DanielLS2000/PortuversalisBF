Vassals were appointed to oversee regions of the kingdom and were granted land, titles, and privileges in exchange for their loyalty to the king. They were responsible for maintaining law and order, collecting taxes, providing soldiers, and making decisions related to local governance."
 hie_geo_last_christian_bastion: "The Last Christian Bastion"
 hie_geo_last_christian_bastion_desc: "The Kingdom of Georgia became the last Christian bastion in the Caucasus region during the Middle Ages due to several factors. Its strategic location and the diplomatic and military prowess of its rulers allowed them to play different powers against each other and maintain their independence. Georgia's Christian identity also united the people and gave them a sense of national identity, and the close cooperation between the Church and the monarchy made it an important center of Christianity in the region."

 hie_geo_kipchak_settlements_desc: "The Christianized Kipchak officers from the Tamar-era settlements, known to the Georgians as naqivchaqari, played a crucial role in suppressing the nobles' revolts of that time. Through their loyal service to the Georgian crown they grew in influence and prestige, and emerged during the reign of George III as a new military aristocracy in sharp contrast to the old, frequently self-interested, Georgian feudal lords."
